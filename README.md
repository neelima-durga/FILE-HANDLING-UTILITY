*DESCRIPTION*:
File Handling Utility in Java:
A file handling utility is a fundamental tool that allows users to read, write, and modify text files. Java provides a robust set of file handling capabilities through classes like File, FileReader, FileWriter, and BufferedReader. This project aims to create a Java-based utility that performs essential file operations while ensuring efficiency, reliability, and clarity in documentation.
Objectives:
The primary goal of this utility is to:
Read data from text files.
Write new data to text files.
Modify existing content in a file.
Demonstrate file operations through a well-documented script.
Technologies Used:
This project will be implemented using:
Java: The primary programming language.
Java IO Package (java.io): Provides classes for input and output operations.
Buffered Streams: For efficient file reading and writing.
Exception Handling: To manage errors like missing files or permission issues.
Features of the File Handling Utility
1. Reading from a File
Uses FileReader and BufferedReader to read content line by line.
Handles exceptions for missing or inaccessible files.
Displays content on the console for verification.
2. Writing to a File
Utilizes FileWriter to append or overwrite data.
Ensures smooth handling of large files with buffered writing.
Provides a user-friendly interface to input text dynamically.
3. Modifying a File
Reads the existing content.
Modifies specific lines or appends new content.
Writes the updated data back to the file.
4. Error Handling
Checks file existence before performing operations.
Manages IOException and FileNotFoundException gracefully.
Ensures secure handling of resources using try-with-resources.
